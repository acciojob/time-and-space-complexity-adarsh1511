<h1> Time Complexity and Space Complexity </h1>
	<p> Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.</p>
